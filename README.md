# Dialogflow Chatbot with Node.js, Express, Moment.js, Dialogflow Fulfillment, Ngrok and Axios

## Introduction
This document provides a guide for creating a chatbot using Dialogflow, Node.js, Express, Moment.js, Dialogflow Fulfillment, and Ngrok. Dialogflow is a powerful natural language understanding platform that enables developers to build conversational interfaces across various platforms. Node.js is a popular server-side JavaScript runtime, while Express is a flexible web application framework for Node.js. Moment.js is a library that simplifies date and time manipulation, Dialogflow Fulfillment facilitates the fulfillment of Dialogflow intents, and Ngrok provides a secure tunnel to expose your local server to the internet.

## Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. Node.js: Install Node.js on your system by visiting the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and following the installation instructions for your specific operating system.

2. Dialogflow Account: Create a Dialogflow account (https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow) and set up a new agent to define your chatbot's behavior.

3. Enable Dialogflow Fulfillment: In your Dialogflow agent settings, enable the fulfillment feature to enable communication between your chatbot and your Node.js application.

4. Ngrok: Download and install Ngrok from the official website (https://ngrok.com). Ngrok is a command-line tool that creates a secure tunnel to expose your local server to the internet.

## Setting Up the Project
To set up your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it using a terminal or command prompt.

2. Initialize a new Node.js project by running the following command:
   ```
   npm init
   ```
   This command will prompt you to provide details about your project and generate a `package.json` file.

3. Install the required dependencies by executing the following command:
   ```
   npm install express dialogflow moment dotenv dialogflow-fulfillment
   ```

4. Create a new file named `server.js` in your project directory.

## Configuring the Express Server
To configure the Express server for your chatbot, perform the following steps:

1. Open `server.js` in a code editor and import the necessary modules at the top of the file:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const { WebhookClient } = require('dialogflow-fulfillment');
   const moment = require('moment');
   require('dotenv').config();
   ```

2. Create an instance of the Express application and define the port number:
   ```javascript
   const app = express();
   const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
   ```

3. Define a route for the webhook endpoint that Dialogflow will use to send requests:
   ```javascript
   app.post('/webhook', express.json(), (req, res) => {
     const agent = new WebhookClient({ request: req, response: res });
     // Handle intent fulfillment here
     agent.handleRequest();
   });
   ```

4. Start the Express server by adding the following code at the end of `index.js`:
   ```javascript
   app.listen(port, () => {
     console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
   });
   ```

## Handling Dialogflow Intents
To handle different Dialogflow intents, follow these steps:

1. Inside the `/webhook` route, you can handle intents using the `agent` object. For example, you can create a handler for a "time" intent:
   ```javascript
   function getTime(agent) {
     const currentTime = moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss');
     agent.add(`The current time is ${currentTime}`);
   }
   ```

2. Attach the `getTime` handler to the appropriate intent using the `intentMap.set()` function:
   ```javascript
   let intentMap = new Map();
   intentMap.set('time.intent.name', getTime);
   agent.handleRequest(intentMap);
   ```

   Replace `'time.intent.name'` with the actual intent name defined in your Dialogflow agent.

## Fulfilling Dialogflow Requests
To fulfill Dialogflow requests and send responses, follow these steps:

1. Enable Dialogflow fulfillment by entering the webhook URL (e.g., `https://your-app-url/webhook`) in your Dialogflow agent settings.

2. When Dialogflow sends a webhook request, your Express server will receive it at the `/webhook` endpoint and trigger the corresponding intent handler.

3. Use the `agent` object to send responses back to Dialogflow. For example, to send a simple text response:
   ```javascript
   agent.add('This is the response from the webhook!');
   ```

4. If you need to access parameters from the user's query, you can use the `agent.parameters` object. For example, to access the value of a parameter named "name":
   ```javascript
   const name = agent.parameters.name;
   ```

5. Once you have handled the intent and constructed a response, use the `agent` object to send the response back to Dialogflow.

## Exposing the Local Server with Ngrok
To expose your local server to the internet using Ngrok, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.

2. Start your Express server by running the following command:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

3. Open another terminal or command prompt window and navigate to the location where you installed Ngrok.

4. Start Ngrok by running the following command, replacing `<PORT_NUMBER>` with the port number of your Express server (e.g., 3000):
   ```
   ngrok http <PORT_NUMBER>
   ```

5. Ngrok will generate a public URL that points to your local server. Look for the forwarding URL labeled "Forwarding" in the Ngrok terminal output (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`).

6. Copy the Ngrok URL and update the webhook URL in your Dialogflow agent settings with the new Ngrok URL (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io/webhook`).

7. Your local server is now exposed to the internet using Ngrok, allowing Dialogflow to communicate with your chatbot.

## Environment Variables
To securely store sensitive information, such as API keys, you can utilize environment variables. Here's how to set up environment variables for your project:

1. Create a `.env` file in your project directory.

2. Inside the `.env` file, define your environment variables using the format `KEY=VALUE`. For example:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   ```

3. In your `index.js` file, add the following code at the top to load the environment variables:
   ```javascript
   require('dotenv').config();
   ```

4. You can access the environment variables using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME` in your code.

## Deploying the Chatbot
To deploy your chatbot, you can choose a hosting platform like Heroku, Google Cloud Platform, or AWS. Each platform has its own deployment process, so refer to the documentation for your chosen platform for detailed instructions.
